There are many reasons to continue your education. There are many reasons why you might convince yourself not to. There are many reasons to doubt the decisions one makes. BUT the reasons to begin a software development endeavor starts with the question... WHY NOT?

- Hard skills will never die
- Creativity is the key to innovation and having the tools to create is the key
- Technology is growing at a rapid rate and I find it fascinating 
- My background is in environmental science and I want to apply Software development to that field 
- I love to learn and challenge myself

So I leave you with this... why not learn something new? The very second that somone can connect new skills they develop with a unique and simple way to make the world a better place, is the very same second that passion and creativity start to EXPLODE.
